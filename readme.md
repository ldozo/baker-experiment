# ING Baker Experiment
This is a sample project group to demonstrate ing-baker library.

Each java project has application.properties and one application-sample.properties as profile.
You can copy and use this sample for your projects.

This repository contains several sub projects
- orchestrator (orchestrator-service): The main service which has the baker code (It might change in the future).
- customers (customers-service): A simple SpringBoot application which simulates crud operations for customers
- accounts (accounts-service): A simple SpringBoot application which simulates crud operations for accounting
- communications (communications-service): A simple SpringBoot application which sends email using smtp service
-bank-ui : A simple Vuejs application which connects to services
